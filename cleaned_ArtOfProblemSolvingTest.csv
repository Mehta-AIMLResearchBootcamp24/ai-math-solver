Her speed in miles per minute is $\tfrac{x}{180}$ . Then, the distance that she drove before hitting the snowstorm is $\tfrac{x}{3}$ . Her speed in snowstorm is reduced $20$ miles per hour, or $\tfrac{1}{3}$ miles per minute. Knowing it took her $276$ minutes in total, we create equation: \[\text{Time before Storm}\, + \, \text{Time after Storm} = \text{Total Time} \Longrightarrow\] \[\frac{\text{Distance before Storm}}{\text{Speed before Storm}} + \frac{\text{Distance in Storm}}{\text{Speed in Storm}} = \text{Total Time} \Longrightarrow \frac{\tfrac{x}{3}}{\tfrac{x}{180}} + \frac{\tfrac{2x}{3}}{\tfrac{x}{180} - \tfrac{1}{3}} = 276\]

Pick's Theorem states that
$A$ $I$ $+$ $\frac{B}{2}$ $1$ , where $I$ is the number of lattice points in the interior of the polygon, and $B$ is the number of lattice points on the boundary of the polygon.
In this case,
$A$ $5$ $+$ $\frac{7}{2}$ $1$ $7.5$
so
$\frac{A}{2}$ $3.75$
The bottom half of the quadrilateral makes a triangle with base $4$ and half the total area, so we can deduce that the height of the triangle must be $\frac{15}{8}$ in order for its area to be $3.75$ . This height is the y coordinate of our desired intersection point.
Note that segment CD lies on the line $y = -3x + 12$ . Substituting in $\frac{15}{8}$ for y, we can find that the x coordinate of our intersection point is $\frac{27}{8}$

Pick's Theorem states that

We can organize our counting based on the food that was served on Wednesday, because whether cake is or is not served on Wednesday seems to significantly affect the number of ways the chef can make said foods for that week.
Case 1: Cake is served on Wednesday. Here, we have three choices for food on Thursday and Saturday since cake must be served on Friday, and none of these choices are cake, which was served Wednesday. Likewise, we have three choices (pie, ice cream, and pudding) for the food served on Tuesday and thus three choices for those served on Monday and Sunday, with these three choices being whatever was not served on Tuesday and Monday, respectively. Hence, for this case, there are $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 243$ possibilities.
Case 2: Cake is not served on Wednesday. Obviously, this means that pie, ice cream, and pudding are our only choices for Wednesday's food. Since cake must be served on Friday, only ice cream, pudding, and cake can be served on Thursday.

We can organize our counting based on the food that was served on Wednesday, because whether cake is or is not served on Wednesday seems to significantly affect the number of ways the chef can make said foods for that week.
Case 1: Cake is served on Wednesday. Here, we have three choices for food on Thursday and Saturday since cake must be served on Friday, and none of these choices are cake, which was served Wednesday. Likewise, we have three choices (pie, ice cream, and pudding) for the food served on Tuesday and thus three choices for those served on Monday and Sunday, with these three choices being whatever was not served on Tuesday and Monday, respectively. Hence, for this case, there are $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 243$ possibilities.
Case 2: Cake is not served on Wednesday. Obviously, this means that pie, ice cream, and pudding are our only choices for Wednesday's food. Since cake must be served on Friday, only ice cream, pudding, and cake can be served on Thursday. However, since one of those foods was chosen for Wednesday, we only have two possibilities for Thursday's food.

Thinking about the distance covered as their distances with respect to each other, they are $0$ distance apart in the first diagram when they haven't started to move yet, some distance $d$ apart in the second diagram when the power boat reaches $B$ , and again $0$ distance apart in the third diagram when they meet. Therefore, with respect to each other, the boat and the raft cover a distance of $d$ on the way there, and again cover a distance of $d$ on when drawing closer.

Let $b$ denote the speed of the power boat (only the power boat, not factoring in current) and $r$ denote the speed of the raft, which, as given by the problem, is also equal to the speed of the current. Thus, from $A$ to $B$ , the boat travels at a velocity of $b+r$ , and on the way back, travels at a velocity of $-(b-r)=r-b$ , since the current aids the boat on the way there, and goes against the boat on the way back. With respect to the raft then, the boat's velocity from $A$ to $B$ becomes $(r+b)-r=b$ , and on the way back it becomes $(r-b)-r=-b$ . Since the boat's velocities with respect to the raft are exact opposites, $b$ and $-b$ , we therefore know that the boat and raft travel apart from each other at the same rate that they travel toward each other.
From this, we have that the boat travels a distance $d$ at rate $b$ with respect to the raft both on the way to $B$ and on the way back.

Multiply $7$ by $3$ $5$ , or $3^2$ for a two-digit factor. There are no more factors to check, as all factors which include $13$ are already counted. Thus, there are an additional $3$ factors.
Multiply $5$ by $3$ or $3^2$ for a two-digit factor. All higher factors have been counted already, so there are $2$ more factors.
Thus, the total number of factors is $3+4+3+2=\boxed{12}$which gives answer letterD </s>"

The case $k<0$ is symmetric to $k>0$ : the blue curve remains the same and the red curve is flipped according to the $x$ axis. Hence we just need to focus on $k>0$

A units digit $k$ for an integer $n$ implies $n \equiv k \pmod{10}$
Let us take this step by step. First, we consider $k^2.$
Note that $k^2 = \left(2008^2 + 2^{2008}\right)^2 = 2008^4 + 2 \cdot 2008^2 \cdot 2^{5016}.$ Now we calculate $k^2 \pmod{10}$
Before continuing, though, we must take note of the following:
\begin{align*} 2^1 &\equiv 2 \pmod {10} \\ 2^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod {10} \\ 2^3 &\equiv 8 \pmod {10} \\ 2^4 &\equiv 6 \pmod {10} \end{align*}
Now, we continue with the calculation.
\begin{align*} 2008^4 + 2 \cdot 2008^2 \cdot 2^{5016} &\equiv 8^4 + 2 \cdot 8^2 \cdot 2^{2008} + 2^{5016} \pmod{10} \\ &\equiv 8^4 + 2^1 \cdot 2^6 \cdot 2^{2008} + 2^{5016} \pmod{10} \\ &\equiv 8^4 + 2^{1+6+2008} + 2^{5016} \pmod{10} \\ &\equiv 6 + 2^{2015} + 6 \pmod{10} \\ &\equiv 6 + 2^{3} + 6 \pmod{10} \\ &\equiv 6 + 8 + 6 \pmod{10} \\ &\equiv 20 \pmod{10} \\ &\equiv 0 \pmod{10} \\ \end{align*}
We do the same with $2^k.$ However, we just need to find $k \pmod 4$ in order to do this calculation since we have the table of $2^k \pmod 10.$
\begin{align*} 2008^2 + 2^{2008} &\equiv 8^2 \pmod{4} \\ &\equiv 64 \pmod 4\\ &\equiv 0 \pmod 4 \end{align*}
This implies that \begin{align*} 2^k &\equiv 2^{4} \pmod{10} \\ &\equiv 6 \pmod{10} \end{align*}

Name: Text, dtype: object [/INST] Alternatively, note that $300p + 210g = 30(10p + 7g)$ is divisible by $30$ no matter what $p$ and $g$ are, so our answer must be divisible by $30$ . Since we want the smallest integer, we can suppose that the answer is $30$ and go on from there. Note that three goats minus two pigs gives us $630 - 600 = 30$ exactly.  Since our supposition can be achieved, the answer is $\boxed{30}$which gives answer letterC </s>"

Name: Text, dtype: object","Let's multiply ticket costs by $2$ , then the half price becomes an integer, and the charity sold $140$ tickets worth a total of $4002$ dollars.
Let $h$ be the number of half price tickets, we then have $140-h$ full price tickets. The cost of $140-h$ full price tickets is equal to the cost of $280-2h$ half price tickets.
Hence we know that $h+(280-2h) = 280-h$ half price tickets cost $4002$ dollars. Then a single full price ticket costs $\frac{4002}{280-h}$ dollars, and this must be an integer. Thus $280-h$ must be a divisor of $4002$ . Keeping in mind that $0\leq h\leq 140$ , we are looking for a divisor between $140$ and $280$ , inclusive.

Name: Text, dtype: object [/INST] Let's multiply ticket costs by $2$ , then the half price becomes an integer, and the charity sold $140$ tickets worth a total of $4002$ dollars.
Let $h$ be the number of half price tickets, we then have $140-h$ full price tickets. The cost of $140-h$ full price tickets is equal to the cost of $280-2h$ half price tickets.
Hence we know that $h+(280-2h) = 280-h$ half price tickets cost $4002$ dollars. Then a single full price ticket costs $\frac{4002}{280-h}$ dollars, and this must be an integer. Thus $280-h$ must be a divisor of $4002$ . Keeping in mind that $0\leq h\leq 140$ , we are looking for a divisor between $140$ and $280$ , inclusive.
The prime factorization of $4002$ is $4002=2\cdot 3\cdot 23\cdot 29$ . We can easily find out that the only divisor of $4002$ within the given range is $2\cdot 3\cdot 29 = 174$

Let's multiply both sides of the equation that naturally follows by 2. We have
